        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf</a><br>In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm is a paper wrote by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout from Stanford University.</p>
<p>This paper proposed a consensus algorithm called Raft, which is more understandable than classic Paxos algorithm.</p>
<p>Consensus algorithms allow a cluster of machines to work together and can survive from failures of some members, they play a key role in building reliable large-scale software systems because of this.</p>
<p>Due to Paxos algorithm is to hard to understand, this paper set their primary goal to be understandability. “In designing Raft we applied specific techniques to improve understandability, including decomposition (Raft separates leader election, log replication, and safety) and state space reduction (relative to Paxos, Raft reduces the degree of nondeterminism and the ways servers can be inconsistent with each other).”</p>
<p>They make a user study with 43 students from two universities, by letting student answer questions after learing Raft and Paxos, they claim Raft is significantly easier to understand than Paxos.</p>
<p>Novel features:<br>Strong leader: log only flow from leader to other servers.<br>Leader election: use randomized timers to elect leaders.<br>Membership changes: use a new joint consensus approach where the majorities of two different configurations overlap during transitions, allows the cluster to continue operating normally during configuration changes.</p>
<p>Replicated state machines<br>Replicated state machines are used to solve a variety of fault tolerance problems in distributed systems.<br>Replicated state machines are typically implemented using a replicated log.  Each server stores a log containing a series of commands, which its state machine executes in order. Each log contains the same commands in the same order, so each state machine processes the same sequence of commands.<br>Keeping the replicated log consistent is the job of the consensus algorithm. The consensus module on a server receives commands from clients and adds them to its log, communicates with the consensus modules on other servers to ensure that every log eventually contains the same requests in the same order, even if some servers fail.<br>Properties of consensus algorithms<br>Safety: never return incorrect result<br>Avaiable: can be fully functional as long as majority of servers are operational<br>do not depend on timing to ensure the consistency of the logs<br>a command can complete as soon as a majority of the cluster has responded</p>
<p>Raft<br>First elect a distinguished leader, then give the leader complete responsibility for managing the replicated log. The leader accepts log entries from clients, replicates them on other servers, and tells servers when it is safe to apply log entries to their state machines. A new leader is elected when the leader fail or disconnected.</p>
<p>A Raft cluster contains several servers. At any given time each server is in one of three states: leader, follower, or candidate.<br>The leader handles all client requests, Followers only respond to leaders and candidates, candidate, is used to elect a new leader.<br>Each term begins with an election, when a candidate wins the election, then it serves as leader for the rest of the term.<br>Each server stores a current term number, Current terms are exchanged whenever servers communicate; if one server’s current term is smaller than the other’s, then it updates its current term to the larger value. If a candidate or leader discovers that its term is out of date, it immediately reverts to follower state. If a server receives a request with a stale term number, it rejects the request.</p>
<p>When servers start up, they begin as followers.  Leaders send periodic heartbeats (AppendEntries RPCs that carry no log entries) to all followers in order to maintain their authority. If a follower receives no communication over a period of time called the election timeout, then it assumes there is no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.<br>To begin an election, a follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state. It then votes for itself and issues RequestVote RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers in the cluster. A candidate continues in this state until one of three things happens: (a) it wins the election, (b) another server establishes itself as leader, or (c) a period of time goes by with no winner.<br>A candidate wins an election if it receives votes from a majority of the servers in the full cluster for the same term. Each server will vote for at most one candidate in a given term, on a first-come-first-served basis.<br>While waiting for votes, a candidate may receive an AppendEntries RPC from another server claiming to be leader. If the leader’s term (included in its RPC) is at least as large as the candidate’s current term, then the candidate recognizes the leader as legitimate and returns to follower state. If the term in the RPC is smaller than the candidate’s current term, then the candidate rejects the RPC and continues in candidate state.<br>If no candidate wins, start another vote after timeout.<br>Raft uses randomized election timeouts from a fixed interval to ensure that split votes are rare and that they are resolved quickly.</p>
<p>The leader append client requests to its log as new entry, then issues AppendEntries RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers to replicate the entry. When majority of the servers replicated the entry, the leader apply the entry and entries before that entry to the state machine and returns the result to client and is called committed. The leader retries AppendEntries RPCs indefinitely until all followers eventually store all log entries.</p>
<p>Each log entry stores a state machine command along with the term number when the entry was received by the leader, an integer index identifying its position in the log.<br>The leader handles inconsistencies by forcing the followers’ logs to duplicate its own. This means that conflicting entries in follower logs will be overwritten with entries from the leader’s log.</p>
<p>The leader maintains a nextIndex for each follower, which is the index of the next log entry the leader will send to that follower. When a leader first comes to power, it initializes all nextIndex values to the index just after the last one in its log.  If a follower’s log is inconsistent with the leader’s, the AppendEntries consistency check will fail in the next AppendEntries RPC. After a rejection, the leader decrements nextIndex and retries the AppendEntries RPC.</p>
<p>A candidate need vote from majority of servers (at least one of these severs has all committed entries), and it only received vote when it is at least up-to-date with that server.<br>Raft determines which of two logs is more up-to-date by comparing the index and term of the last entries in the logs. If the logs have last entries with different terms, then<br>the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date.</p>
<p>Only log entries from the leader’s current term are committed by counting replicas; once an entry from the current term has been committed in this way, then all prior entries are committed indirectly because of the Log Matching Property.</p>
<p>A committed entry is replicated in majority of servers, and a candidate need a majority votes to be the leader, so it has to contain all committed entries to get enough votes.</p>
<p>When follower or candidate crashes, Raft retry requests indefinitely.</p>
<p>If message exchanges take longer than the typical time between server crashes, candidates will not stay up long enough to win an election; without a steady leader, Raft cannot make progress.<br>Raft will be able to elect and maintain a steady leader as long as the system satisfies the following timing requirement:<br>broadcastTime ≪ electionTimeout ≪ MTBF<br>broadcastTime is the average time it takes a server to send RPCs in parallel to every server in the cluster and receive their responses<br>MTBF is the average time between failures for a single server.</p>
<p>Cluster membership changes<br>In Raft the cluster first switches to a transitional configuration we call joint consensus; once the joint consensus has been committed, the system then transitions to the new configuration.<br>• Log entries are replicated to all servers in both configurations.<br>• Any server from either configuration may serve as leader.<br>• Agreement (for elections and entry commitment) requires separate majorities from both the old and new configurations.<br>When the leader receives a request to change the configuration from Cold to Cnew, it stores the configuration for joint consensus (Cold,new in the figure) as a log entry and replicates that entry. A server always uses the latest configuration in its log.  If the leader crashes, a new leader may be chosen under either Cold or Cold,new, depending on whether the winning candidate has received Cold,new. In any case, Cnew cannot make unilateral decisions during this period.<br>Once Cold,new has been committed, neither Cold nor Cnew can make decisions without approval of the other. It is now safe for the leader to create a log entry describing Cnew and replicate it to the cluster.</p>
<p>Before the configuration change, the new servers join the cluster as non-voting members (the leader replicates log entries to them, but they are not considered for majorities). Once the new servers have caught up with the rest of the cluster, the reconfiguration can proceed.</p>
<p>If leader is not part of new configuration, the leader steps down (returns to follower state) once it has committed the Cnew log entry. it replicates log entries but does not count itself in majorities</p>
<p>To avoid removed servers to start elections, servers disregard RequestVote RPCs when they believe a current leader exists. if a server receives a RequestVote RPC within the minimum election timeout of hearing from a current leader, it does not update its term or grant its vote.</p>
